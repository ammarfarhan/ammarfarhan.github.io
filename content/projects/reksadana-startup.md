## Description

I conducted a customer segmentation analysis for an Indonesian investment startup that offers a mobile application for buying and selling mutual funds. 

The objective was to extract insights from the data and identify suitable thematic campaigns for the upcoming month, considering the allocated budget and specific target segments. Additionally, I performed a benefit-cost analysis to evaluate the potential returns of the proposed campaigns.
